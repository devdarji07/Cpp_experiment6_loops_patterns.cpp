# ⭐ C++ Pattern Programs – Inverted Star & Alphabetic Pattern

Welcome to the Pattern Programs Repository! This document provides a clear overview and implementation of two classic C++ pattern programs:

- 🔻 **Inverted Star Triangle**  
- 🔠 **Alphabetic Triangle**

---

## 🎯 Aim

To understand and implement basic nested loops in C++ through visual pattern programming, focusing on:

- ✅ Mastery of control flow using `for` loops  
- ✅ Character manipulation using `char` data type  
- ✅ Enhancement of logical thinking via pattern logic

---

## 📌 1. Inverted Star Triangle

### 🧠 Explanation:

- The pattern starts with **4 stars** and reduces by **1** on each new line.  
- We use a **decreasing outer loop** to control the number of lines.  
- The **inner loop** prints stars for each row.

### 🖥️ Output Pattern:

```
****
***
**
*
```

## 📌 2. Alphabetic Triangle

### 🧠 Explanation:

- This pattern prints increasing characters starting from `'A'`.  
- The outer loop runs from `1` to `4`, representing the rows.  
- The inner loop prints characters starting from `'A'` up to the current row count.

### 🖥️ Output Pattern:

```
A
A B
A B C
A B C D
```

## ✅ Learning Outcome

By completing these patterns, you will:

- Understand **nested loop structures**
- Learn how to work with **characters using ASCII values**
- Gain practice in **building patterns logically**
