# C++ Programs: Decision Control and Loop Statements

This repository contains basic **C++ programs** focusing on **decision control** and **loop statements**, essential for understanding program flow and iteration.

## 1. Print Even Numbers from 1 to 20 Using While Loop

**Logic:**
- Initialize `i = 1`.
- Use a **while loop** that runs while `i <= 20`.
- Inside the loop, check if `i % 2 == 0`. If true, print `i`.
- Increment `i` by 1 after each iteration.

**Theory:**
- The **while loop** is an *entry-controlled loop*, meaning the condition is checked before the body executes.
- Useful for processing a range of values with conditional checks inside the loop.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Looping constructs  
- Entry-controlled loop  
- Conditional execution inside loop

## 2. Print "SIT" 5 Times Using For Loop

**Logic:**
- Use a **for loop** from `i = 0` to `i < 5`.
- Print `"SIT"` in each iteration.

**Theory:**
- The **for loop** is ideal for fixed-count iterations.
- It contains *initialization*, *condition checking*, and *update* in one line.

**Concepts Covered:**
- For loop structure  
- Fixed iteration  
- Output repetition

## 3. Print Even Numbers from 0 to 10 Using For Loop

**Logic:**
- Run a **for loop** from `0` to `10`.
- Print only if `i % 2 == 0`.

**Theory:**
- The modulo (`%`) operator checks divisibility.
- Combining loops with conditionals filters output.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Conditional checks in a loop  
- Modulus operator  
- Filtering output

## 4. Limited Attempts for System Lock

**Logic:**
- Allow **3 attempts** for correct password entry.
- Reduce tries after each wrong input.
- If correct, grant access; otherwise, lock the system.

**Theory:**
- Loops + conditionals simulate basic authentication systems.

**Concepts Covered:**
- While loop  
- Authentication logic  
- Loop termination

## Pattern Programs

These programs demonstrate **star** and **number patterns** using **nested loops** — perfect for mastering loop control and output formatting.

### a. Inverted Right-Angle Triangle

**Filename:** `inverted_right_angle_triangle.cpp`

**Description:**
Prints stars where each row has fewer stars than the previous, forming an inverted right-angled triangle.

**Example Output:**


## ✅ Learning Outcome

By completing these patterns, you will:

- Understand **nested loop structures**
- Learn how to work with **characters using ASCII values**
- Gain practice in **building patterns logically**
